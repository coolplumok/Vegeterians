## Acknowledgement of accomplishments

Gab is grateful for the work performed by the [Mastadon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) team. Their accomplishments have inspired Gab to completely open the platform, federate the social network, and take other steps forward in terms of user privacy, user data control, user freedom, and trust.

Our hope is that some day circumstances will allow a comprehensive list of contributors to be displayed for this project from both the Gab and Mastodon communities, because a lot of work has gone into, and will continue to go into, this system, which we believe will change the world, and for which the authors of contributions to this codebase deserve due credit.
